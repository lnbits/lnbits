      <p>
        Milking faucets with software, known as "assmilking", seems at first to
        be black-hat, although in fact there might be some unexplored use cases.
        An LNURL withdraw gives someone the right to pull funds, which can be
        done over time. An LNURL withdraw could be used outside of just faucets,
        to provide money streaming and repeat payments.<br />Paste or scan an
        LNURL withdraw, enter the amount for the AMilk to pull and the frequency
        for it to be pulled.<br />
