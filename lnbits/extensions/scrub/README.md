# Scrub

## Automatically forward funds (Scrub) that get paid to the wallet to an LNURLpay or Lightning Address

SCRUB is a small but handy extension that allows a user to take advantage of all the functionalities inside **LNbits** and upon a payment received to your LNbits wallet, automatically forward it to your desired wallet via LNURL or LNAddress!

<small>Only whole values, integers, are Scrubbed, amounts will be rounded down (example: 6.3 will be 6)! The decimals, if existing, will be kept in your wallet!</small>
