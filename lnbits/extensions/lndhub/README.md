<h1>lndhub Extension</h1>
<h2>*connect to your lnbits wallet from BlueWallet or Zeus*</h2>

Lndhub has nothing to do with lnd, it is just the name of the HTTP/JSON protocol https://bluewallet.io/ uses to talk to their Lightning custodian server at https://lndhub.io/.

Despite not having been planned to this, Lndhub because somewhat a standard for custodian wallet communication when https://t.me/lntxbot and https://zeusln.app/ implemented the same interface. And with this extension LNbits joins the same club.
