        <b>WARNING: LNURL must be used over https or TOR</b><br />
        LNURL is a range of lightning-network standards that allow us to use
        lightning-network differently. An LNURL satsdice is the permission for
        someone to pull a certain amount of funds from a lightning wallet. In
        this extension time is also added - an amount can be satsdice over a
        period of time. A typical use case for an LNURL satsdice is a faucet,
        although it is a very powerful technology, with much further reaching
        implications. For example, an LNURL satsdice could be minted to pay for
        a subscription service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploring LNURL and finding use cases, is really helping inform
        lightning protocol development, rather than the protocol dictating how
        lightning-network should be engaged with.
