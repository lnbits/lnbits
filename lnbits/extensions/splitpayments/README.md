- set how much, in percentage, this wallet will receive from every payment sent to the source wallets

3. When done, click "SAVE TARGETS" to make the splits effective

4. You can have several wallets to split to, as long as the sum of the percentages is under or equal to 100%

5. When the source wallet receives a payment, the extension will automatically split the corresponding values to every wallet\
