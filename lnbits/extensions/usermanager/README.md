# User Manager

## Make and manage users/wallets

To help developers use LNbits to manage their users, the User Manager extension allows the creation and management of users and wallets.

For example, a games developer may be developing a game that needs each user to have their own wallet, LNbits can be included in the developers stack as the user and wallet manager. Or someone wanting to manage their family's wallets (wife, children, parents, etc...) or you want to host a community Lightning Network node and want to manage wallets for the users.
