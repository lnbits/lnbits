<h1>Jitsi Extension</h1>

Host a Jitsi meeting with a chatBot that allows participants to send funds to each other.


<h2>If your extension has API endpoints, include useful ones here</h2>

# Usage.

- Log into LNbits and enable the Jitsi extension.
- Select the Jitsi extension from the sidebar menu.
- Enter the name/title of the meeting then click "Start Jitsi Meeting"
- When you start an Jitsi conference call using LNbits, note that the chat bot runs as you, the host of the meeting.
- In the "Join Meeting" dialog, enter the name *ChatBot*.
    - If you want to participate in the meeting, you should join as a different user. You can name the host user *ChatBot*, for example.
- Note that if the *ChatBot* participant (the hosting LNbits user), types in chat commands, they will not run, which is, again, why you should join the conference call as a different user and not as the *ChatBot*. 
- When a participant joins the meeting, they receive a chat message that tells them their LNBits wallet url and current balance.
- As a participant, type `/help` to view available chatbot commands.
