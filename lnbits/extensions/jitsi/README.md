# Usage.

- Log into LNbits and enable the Jitsi extension.
- When you start an Jitsi conference call using LNbits, note that the chat bot runs as you, the host.
- Therefore, if you want to participate in the conference call, you should join as a different user. You can name the host user `ChatBot`.
- Note that if you, the hosting LNbits user, type in chat commands, they will not run, which is, again, why you should join the conference call as a different user and not as the `ChatBot`.
