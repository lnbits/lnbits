    'Arr, easy to set up and lightweight, LNbits can run on any lightning-network funding source, currently supporting LND, Core Lightning, OpenNode, LNPay and even LNbits itself!

Being able to partition booty makes LNbits a useful tool for money management and as a development tool. Arr, extensions add extra functionality to LNbits so ye can experiment with a range of cutting-edge technologies on the lightning network.
