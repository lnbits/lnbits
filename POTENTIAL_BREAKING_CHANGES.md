# Potential Breaking Changes Analysis - PR #3376

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-04
**PR**: Shared Wallets (Phase 1) - #3376
**Analyzed By**: Claude Code

## Overview

This document identifies areas where the shared wallets feature might inadvertently break existing functionality.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK AREAS

### 1. Payment API - Invoice Creation with Invoice Keys

**File**: `lnbits/core/views/payment_api.py:266-267`

**Issue**: Permission check called for ALL invoice creation requests
```python
# Check if user has permission to create invoices on shared wallets
if request:
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "create_invoice")
```

**Problem**:
- This check runs for ALL invoice creation (incoming payments), not just admin key requests
- Uses `invoice_key` (not admin key) which doesn't have session context
- The `if request:` guard doesn't distinguish between invoice keys and admin keys

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH**

**Affected Use Cases**:
1. ‚úÖ **Browser UI** - Has session, should work
2. ‚ùå **API-only invoice creation** - No session available
3. ‚ùå **LNURL callbacks** - External services creating invoices
4. ‚ùå **Extensions** - May create invoices programmatically
5. ‚ùå **Webhooks** - Automated invoice creation

**Breaking Scenarios**:
```bash
# This might break for API-only usage without session
curl -X POST https://lnbits.com/api/v1/payments \
  -H "X-Api-Key: INVOICE_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{"out": false, "amount": 100}'
```

**Expected Error**:
```
403 Forbidden: Shared wallet requires session authentication
```

**Root Cause**:
The permission check doesn't differentiate between:
- Invoice keys (should be unrestricted for incoming payments)
- Admin keys (should check permissions for shared wallets)

---

### 2. Payment API - Outgoing Payments (Pay Invoice)

**File**: `lnbits/core/views/payment_api.py:243-245`

**Current Code**:
```python
if invoice_data.out is True and wallet.key_type == KeyType.admin:
    # Check if user has permission to pay invoices on shared wallets
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "pay_invoice")
```

**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM** (Already Fixed)

**Status**: ‚úÖ This is correctly scoped to `KeyType.admin` only

**Affected Use Cases**:
1. ‚úÖ **Browser payments** - Has session, works
2. ‚úÖ **API-only payments (unshared wallets)** - Early return bypasses session check
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **API-only payments (shared wallets)** - Will fail (by design for security)

**Notes**: This is working as intended - shared wallets should require session auth for payments.

---

## üü° MEDIUM RISK AREAS

### 3. Wallet Settings Modifications

**Files**:
- `lnbits/core/views/wallet_api.py:68` - Update wallet name
- `lnbits/core/views/wallet_api.py:100` - Update stored paylinks
- `lnbits/core/views/wallet_api.py:118` - Update wallet settings

**Change**: Replaced `require_admin_key` ‚Üí `require_wallet_owner`

**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM**

**Affected Use Cases**:
1. ‚úÖ **Wallet owner via UI** - Works fine
2. ‚úÖ **Wallet owner via API** - Works fine
3. ‚ùå **Shared users** - Now blocked (intended behavior)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Extensions/automation** - May break if they modify wallet settings

**Breaking Scenario**:
```python
# Extension code that modifies wallet name using admin key
# This will now fail if the admin key belongs to a shared user
await update_wallet_name(wallet_id, "New Name", admin_key)
```

**Impact**: Extensions that assume admin key = full access will break

**Mitigation**: Extensions should check if user is owner before modifying settings

---

## üü¢ LOW RISK AREAS

### 4. Service Worker Changes

**File**: `lnbits/core/templates/service-worker.js`

**Changes**: Added wallet sharing UI routes to cache

**Risk Level**: üü¢ **LOW**

**Impact**: Minimal - only affects PWA caching strategy

---

### 5. Database Migration

**File**: `lnbits/core/migrations.py:748-779`

**Changes**: Adds `wallet_shares` table

**Risk Level**: üü¢ **LOW**

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - safe for re-runs
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE` - safe cleanup
- ‚úÖ Migration is additive only (no schema changes to existing tables)

**Potential Issues**:
- None identified - migration is well-designed

---

## üîç SPECIFIC BREAKING CHANGE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: Invoice Creation Broken for API-Only Usage

**Reproduction**:
1. Create invoice using invoice key from API (no browser session)
2. Request will fail with 403 if wallet is shared

**Code Path**:
```
POST /api/v1/payments
  ‚Üí api_payments_create() [payment_api.py:236]
  ‚Üí check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "create_invoice") [line 267]
  ‚Üí check_access_token() [decorators.py:237]
  ‚Üí Returns None (no session)
  ‚Üí Raises 403: "Shared wallet requires session authentication"
```

**Why This Breaks**:
The function checks permissions for invoice creation even when using an invoice key (which should be unrestricted for incoming payments).

**Fix Required**:
```python
# Only check permissions for admin keys
if invoice_data.out is True and wallet.key_type == KeyType.admin:
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "pay_invoice")
elif wallet.key_type == KeyType.admin:  # ‚Üê ADD THIS
    # Only check create_invoice permission for admin keys
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "create_invoice")

# Invoice keys should not trigger permission checks for incoming payments
```

---

### Issue #2: Extensions May Break

**Affected Extensions**:
Any extension that:
1. Modifies wallet settings (name, currency, color)
2. Updates stored paylinks
3. Assumes admin key = full permissions

**Example Extension Code That Will Break**:
```python
# extension/views.py
@router.post("/configure")
async def configure_wallet(wallet: WalletTypeInfo = Depends(require_admin_key)):
    # This will now fail if user is a shared user (not owner)
    await update_wallet(wallet.id, color="blue")
```

**Fix For Extensions**:
```python
# Check if user is owner before modifying settings
from lnbits.decorators import require_wallet_owner

@router.post("/configure")
async def configure_wallet(wallet: WalletTypeInfo = Depends(require_wallet_owner)):
    await update_wallet(wallet.id, color="blue")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Critical Fix #1: Invoice Creation Permission Check

**Problem**: Line 266-267 in `payment_api.py` checks permissions for ALL invoice creation

**Current Code**:
```python
# Check if user has permission to create invoices on shared wallets
if request:
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "create_invoice")
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# Only check CREATE_INVOICE permission for admin keys creating invoices
# Invoice keys should always be allowed to create invoices (incoming payments)
if wallet.key_type == KeyType.admin and not invoice_data.out:
    await check_wallet_payment_permission(wallet, request, "create_invoice")
```

**Rationale**:
1. Invoice keys are meant for creating invoices (receiving payments)
2. They don't have session context (API-only usage)
3. Permission checks should only apply to admin keys
4. Incoming payments (invoices) should not require session auth

---

### Critical Fix #2: Better Error Messages

**Problem**: Generic "Shared wallet requires session authentication" doesn't explain the issue

**Recommendation**:
```python
# In check_wallet_payment_permission
if not access_token:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=HTTPStatus.FORBIDDEN,
        detail=(
            f"This wallet is shared and requires browser session authentication "
            f"to {operation}. API-only usage is not supported for shared wallets. "
            f"Please use the wallet owner's admin key or access via browser."
        ),
    )
```

## üß™ TEST RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority Tests Needed:

1. **Invoice Creation with Invoice Key (Unshared Wallet)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/payments \
     -H "X-Api-Key: INVOICE_KEY" \
     -d '{"out": false, "amount": 100}'
   ```
   Expected: ‚úÖ 200 OK (should create invoice)

2. **Invoice Creation with Invoice Key (Shared Wallet)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/payments \
     -H "X-Api-Key: INVOICE_KEY" \
     -d '{"out": false, "amount": 100}'
   ```
   Expected: ‚úÖ 200 OK (invoice keys should always work)
   Current: ‚ùå 403 Forbidden (BROKEN)

3. **Payment with Admin Key (Unshared Wallet, API-only)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/payments \
     -H "X-Api-Key: ADMIN_KEY" \
     -d '{"out": true, "bolt11": "lnbc..."}'
   ```
   Expected: ‚úÖ 200 OK (early return for unshared wallets)

4. **Payment with Admin Key (Shared Wallet, API-only)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/payments \
     -H "X-Api-Key: ADMIN_KEY" \
     -d '{"out": true, "bolt11": "lnbc..."}'
   ```
   Expected: ‚ùå 403 Forbidden (by design - shared wallets need session)

5. **Extension Wallet Settings Modification**
   - Test: Extension modifies wallet name using admin key
   - Expected: ‚úÖ Works for owner, ‚ùå Fails for shared user

---

## üìù CHANGELOG FOR USERS

### Breaking Changes:

1. **Invoice Creation via API**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **BROKEN**: Creating invoices with invoice keys may fail for shared wallets
   - **Workaround**: Use browser UI until fixed
   - **Fix Status**: Needs code change

2. **Wallet Settings for Shared Users**
   - ‚úÖ **INTENTIONAL**: Shared users can no longer modify wallet settings
   - **Workaround**: Ask wallet owner to make changes
   - **Fix Status**: Working as designed

3. **Extension Compatibility**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **POTENTIALLY BROKEN**: Extensions that modify wallet settings may fail
   - **Workaround**: Check if extension supports shared wallets
   - **Fix Status**: Extensions need updates

---

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

### Critical Issues Found: 1

**Issue**: Invoice creation permission check is too broad and will break API-only usage.

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå LNURL services creating invoices
- ‚ùå Extensions creating invoices programmatically
- ‚ùå Automated invoice generation
- ‚ùå Webhooks and callbacks

**Recommendation**: Apply Fix #1 before merging PR

### By-Design Changes: 2

1. ‚úÖ Shared users cannot modify wallet settings (intentional security feature)
2. ‚úÖ Shared wallet payments require session auth (intentional security feature)

### Total Breaking Changes: 1 critical, 2 by-design
