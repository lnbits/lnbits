# LNbits — The most powerful Bitcoin & Lightning toolkit

> Run it for yourself, for your community, or as part of a larger stack.



## What is LNbits?
LNbits is a lightweight Python server that sits on top of your Lightning funding source. It gives you safe, isolated wallets, a clean API, and an extension system for rapidly adding features - without locking you into a single node implementation. The Inspiration for LNBits came from ideas pioneered by **OpenNode** and **LNPay** — both today work as funding sources for LNbits.


## What you can do with LNbits
- **Harden app security:** Create per-wallet API keys so individual apps never touch your full balance.
- **Extend functionality fast:** Install extensions to explore and ship Lightning features with minimal code.
- **Build into your stack:** Use the LNbits HTTP API to integrate payments, wallets, and accounting.
- **Cover LNURL flows:** Use LNbits as a reliable fallback wallet for LNURL.
- **Demo in minutes:** Spin up instant wallets for workshops, proofs-of-concept, and user testing.



## Funding sources
LNbits runs on top of most Lightning backends. Choose the one you already operate - or swap later without changing your app architecture.

- Read the [funding source guide](https://docs.lnbits.org/guide/wallets.html)

## LNbits account system

LNbits is packaged with tools to help manage funds, such as a table of transactions, line chart of spending, export to csv. Each wallet also comes with its own API keys, to help partition the exposure of your funding source.

## LNbits extension universe

Extend YOUR LNbits to meet YOUR needs.

All non-core features are installed as extensions, reducing your code base and making your LNbits unique to you. Extend your LNbits install in any direction, and even create and share your own extensions.
