# LNbits v0.1 BETA, free and open-source lightning-network wallet/accounts system

Use [lnbits.com](https://lnbits.com), or run your own LNbits server!

LNbits is a very simple Python server that sits on top of any funding source, and can be used as:

* Accounts system to mitigate the risk of exposing applications to your full balance, via unique API keys for each wallet
* Extendable platform for exploring lightning-network functionality via LNbits extension framework
* Part of a development stack via LNbits API
* Fallback wallet for the LNURL scheme
* Instant wallet for LN demonstrations

LNbits can run on top of any lightning-network funding source, currently there is support for LND, c-lightning, Spark, LNpay, OpenNode, lntxbot, with more being added regularily.

See [lnbits.org](https://lnbits.org) for more detailed documentation.

Checkout the LNbits [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPj3KCksGbSYG0ciIQUWJru1dWstPHshe) video series.

LNbits is inspired by all the great work of [opennode.com](https://www.opennode.com/), and in particular [lnpay.co](https://lnpay.co/). Both work as excellent funding sources for LNbits.

## Running LNbits

See the [install guide](docs/guide/installation.md) for details on installation and setup.

### Contributing to LNbits

There's a [slightly different setup](docs/devs/installation.md) if you want to contribute to LNbits, but if your changes don't require adding or removing any package dependencies you don't have to bother with that, just follow the [normal installation](docs/guide/installation.md) steps.

## LNbits as an account system

LNbits is packaged with tools to help manage funds, such as a table of transactions, line chart of spending, export to csv + more to come..

Each wallet also comes with its own API keys, to help partition the exposure of your funding source.

## LNbits as an LNURL-withdraw fallback

LNURL has a fallback scheme, so if scanned by a regular QR code reader it can default to a URL. LNbits exploits this to generate an instant wallet using the [LNURL-withdraw](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-withdraw.md).

![lnurl fallback](https://i.imgur.com/CPBKHIv.png)

Using **lnbits.com/?lightning="LNURL-withdraw"** will trigger a withdraw that builds an LNbits wallet.
Example use would be an ATM, which utilises LNURL, if the user scans the QR with a regular QR code scanner app, they will stilll be able to access the funds.

## LNbits as an insta-wallet

Wallets can be easily generated and given out to people at events (one click multi-wallet generation to be added soon).
"Go to this  website", has a lot less friction than "Download this app".
