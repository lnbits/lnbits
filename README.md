# LNbits v0.10 BETA, free and open-source Lightning wallet accounts system

(Join us on [https://t.me/lnbits](https://t.me/lnbits))

LNbits is beta, for responsible disclosure of any concerns please contact lnbits@pm.me

Use [legend.lnbits.com](https://legend.lnbits.com), or run your own LNbits server!

LNbits is a Python server that sits on top of any funding source. It can be used as:

* Accounts system to mitigate the risk of exposing applications to your full balance via unique API keys for each wallet
* Extendable platform for exploring Lightning network functionality via the LNbits extension framework
* Part of a development stack via LNbits API
* Fallback wallet for the LNURL scheme
* Instant wallet for LN demonstrations

LNbits can run on top of any Lightning funding source. It supports LND, CLN, Eclair, Spark, LNpay, OpenNode, LightningTipBot, and with more being added regularly.

See [LNbits Wiki](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/wiki/) for more detailed documentation.

Checkout the LNbits [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPj3KCksGbSYG0ciIQUWJru1dWstPHshe) video series.

LNbits is inspired by all the great work of [opennode.com](https://www.opennode.com/), and in particular [lnpay.co](https://lnpay.co/). Both work as funding sources for LNbits.

## Running LNbits

See the [install guide](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/wiki/LNbits-Documentation#install-options) for details on installation and setup.

## LNbits as an account system

LNbits is packaged with tools to help manage funds, such as a table of transactions, line chart of spending, export to csv + more to come..

Each wallet also comes with its own API keys, to help partition the exposure of your funding source.

## LNbits as an LNURL-withdraw fallback

LNURL has a fallback scheme, so if scanned by a regular QR code reader it can default to a URL. LNbits exploits this to generate an instant wallet using the [LNURL-withdraw](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-withdraw.md).

![lnurl fallback](https://i.imgur.com/CPBKHIv.png)

Using **lnbits.com/?lightning="LNURL-withdraw"** will trigger a withdraw that builds an LNbits wallet.
Example use would be an ATM, which utilises LNURL, if the user scans the QR with a regular QR code scanner app, they will still be able to access the funds.

## LNbits as an instant wallet

Wallets can be easily generated and given out to people at events. "Go to this  website", has a lot less friction than "Download this app".
