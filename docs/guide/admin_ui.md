# LNBits Admin UI

We introduced the Admin UI as the new default to make setup simpler and more straightforward. Instead of hand editing the `.env` file, you configure key server settings directly in the frontend with clear labels and guardrails.

<ins>On a fresh install the Admin UI is enabled by default</ins>, and at first launch you are prompted to create **Super User** credentials so that sensitive operations, such as switching funding sources, remain in trusted hands. When the Admin UI is enabled, configuration is written to and read from the database; for all settings managed by the UI, the parameters in `.env` are largely no longer used. If you disable the Admin UI, the `.env` file becomes the single source of truth again.

For privileged actions and role details see **[Super User](./super_user.md)** & [User Roles](./user_roles.md)  
For a complete reference of legacy variables consult **[.env.example](../../.env.example)**.

> [!WARNING]
> Some settings remain `.env` only. Use **[.env.example](../../.env.example#L3-L87)** as the authoritative reference for those variables.

## What you can do with the Admin UI

- Switch funding sources and other server level settings
- Manage who can access LNbits (**[Allowed Users](#allowed-users)**)
- Promote or demote Admin Users
- Gate extensions to Admins only or disable them globally
- Adjust balances with credit or debit
- Adjust site customization

> [!NOTE]
> See **[Super User](./super_user.md)** for the role and permission differences compared to Admin Users.

## Enabling or disabling the Admin UI

The Admin UI is enabled by default on new installs. To change the state:

1. Stop LNbits

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop lnbits.service
   ```

2. Edit your `.env`

   ```
   cd ~/lnbits
   sudo nano .env
   ```

3. Set one of

   ```
   # Enable Admin UI
   LNBITS_ADMIN_UI=true

   # Disable Admin UI
   LNBITS_ADMIN_UI=false
   ```

4. Start LNbits

   ```
   sudo systemctl start lnbits.service
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> With the Admin UI enabled, config is DB-backed and UI-managed settings ignore .env. Disable it to revert to [.env](../../.env.example) as the single source of truth.

## Reset to defaults

Using `Reset to defaults` in the Admin UI wipes stored settings. After a restart, a new `Super User` is created and the old one is no longer valid.

## First run and Super User ID

On first start with the Admin UI enabled you will be prompted to generate a Super User. If you need to read it from disk later:

```bash
cat /lnbits/data/.super_user
# example
123de4bfdddddbbeb48c8bc8382fe123
```

> [!WARNING]
> For security reasons, Super Users and Admin users must authenticate with credentials (username and password).

After login you will see **Settings** and **Users** in the sidebar between **Wallets** and **Extensions**, plus a role badge in the top left.

## Allowed Users

When set **at least one**, LNbits becomes private: only the listed users and Admins can access the frontend. Account creation is disabled automatically. You can also disable account creation explicitly.

> [!WARNING]
> Assign your own account first when enabling **Allowed Users** to avoid locking yourself out. If you do get locked out, use your Super User to recover access.
