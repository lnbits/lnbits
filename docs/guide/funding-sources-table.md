# Backend Wallet Comparison Table

LNbits lets you choose **how your wallets are funded** — from fully self-custodial nodes to simple hosted services. You can switch the funding source **without touching your apps, users, or extensions**. That means you can start fast, learn, and later upgrade to more control and privacy when you are ready.

**Why this matters**
- **Flexibility:** Pick the backend that fits your skills and constraints today, change it later with minimal friction.
- **Speed to ship:** Use a hosted option to get live quickly; move to a node when you need more control.
- **Scalability:** Match cost and maintenance to your stage — from hobby to production.
- **Privacy and compliance:** Choose between self-custody and provider-managed options depending on your requirements.

Below is a side-by-side comparison of Lightning funding sources you can use with LNbits.

> [!NOTE]
> “Backend Wallet” and “Funding Source” mean the same thing — the wallet or service that funds your LNbits.
