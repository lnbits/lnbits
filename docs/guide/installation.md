# Basic installation

Note that by default LNbits uses SQLite as its database, which is simple and effective but you can configure it to use PostgreSQL instead which is also described in a section below.

## Option 1: AppImage (LInux)

### AppImage (Linux)

Go to [releases](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/releases) and pull latest AppImage, or:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfuse2
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/lnbits/lnbits/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | endswith(".AppImage")) | .browser_download_url') -O LNbits-latest.AppImage
chmod +x LNbits-latest.AppImage
./LNbits-latest.AppImage --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

LNbits will create a folder for db and extension files in the folder the AppImage runs from.

## Option 2: Poetry (recommended for developers)

It is recommended to use the latest version of Poetry. Make sure you have Python version `3.12` installed.

### Install Python 3.12

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y python3.12 python3.12-dev # ensure correct headers needed for secp256k1
sudo apt install -y pkg-config python3-dev build-essential # ensure correct headers
python3 --version
```

### Install Poetry

```sh
# If path 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' fails, use the path echoed by the install
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - && export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### install LNbits

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits.git
cd lnbits
poetry env use 3.12
git checkout main
poetry install --only main
cp .env.example .env
# Optional: to set funding source amongst other options via the env `nano .env`
```

#### Running the server

```sh
poetry run lnbits
# To change port/host pass 'poetry run lnbits --port 9000 --host 0.0.0.0'
# adding --debug in the start-up command above to help your troubleshooting and generate a more verbose output
# Note that you have to add the line DEBUG=true in your .env file, too.
```

#### LNbits-cli

```sh
# A very useful terminal client for getting the supersuer ID, updating extensions, etc
poetry run lnbits-cli --help
```

#### Updating the server

```sh
cd lnbits
# Stop LNbits with `ctrl + x`
git pull
# Keep your poetry install up to date, this can be done with `poetry self update`
poetry install --only main
# Start LNbits with `poetry run lnbits`
```

## Option 3: Nix

```sh
# Install nix. If you have installed via another manager, remove and use this install (from https://nixos.org/download)
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

# Enable nix-command and flakes experimental features for nix:
echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> /etc/nix/nix.conf

# Add cachix for cached binaries
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
cachix use lnbits

# Clone and build LNbits
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits.git
cd lnbits
nix build

mkdir data
```

#### Running the server

```sh
nix run
```

Ideally you would set the environment via the `.env` file,
but you can also set the env variables or pass command line arguments:

```sh
# .env variables are currently passed when running, but LNbits can be managed with the admin UI.
LNBITS_ADMIN_UI=true ./result/bin/lnbits --port 9000

# Once you have created a user, you can set as the super_user
SUPER_USER=be54db7f245346c8833eaa430e1e0405 LNBITS_ADMIN_UI=true ./result/bin/lnbits --port 9000
```

## Option 4: Docker

use latest version from docker hub

```sh
docker pull lnbits/lnbits
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lnbits/lnbits/main/.env.example -O .env
mkdir data
docker run --detach --publish 5000:5000 --name lnbits --volume ${PWD}/.env:/app/.env --volume ${PWD}/data/:/app/data lnbits/lnbits
```

build the image yourself

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits.git
cd lnbits
docker build -t lnbits/lnbits .
cp .env.example .env
mkdir data
docker run --detach --publish 5000:5000 --name lnbits --volume ${PWD}/.env:/app/.env --volume ${PWD}/data/:/app/data lnbits/lnbits
```

## Option 5: Fly.io

Fly.io is a docker container hosting platform that has a generous free tier. You can host LNbits for free on Fly.io for personal use.

First, sign up for an account at [Fly.io](https://fly.io) (no credit card required).

Then, install the Fly.io CLI onto your device [here](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/).

After install is complete, the command will output a command you should copy/paste/run to get `fly` into your `$PATH`. Something like:

```
flyctl was installed successfully to /home/ubuntu/.fly/bin/flyctl
Manually add the directory to your $HOME/.bash_profile (or similar)
  export FLYCTL_INSTALL="/home/ubuntu/.fly"
  export PATH="$FLYCTL_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

You can either run those commands, then `source ~/.bash_profile` or, if you don't, you'll have to call Fly from `~/.fly/bin/flyctl`.

Once installed, run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits.git
cd lnbits
fly auth login
[complete login process]
fly launch
```

You'll be prompted to enter an app name, region, postgres (choose no), deploy now (choose no).

You'll now find a file in the directory called `fly.toml`. Open that file and modify/add the following settings.

Note: Be sure to replace `${PUT_YOUR_LNBITS_ENV_VARS_HERE}` with all relevant environment variables in `.env` or `.env.example`. Environment variable strings should be quoted here, so if in `.env` you have `LNBITS_ENDPOINT=https://demo.lnbits.com` in `fly.toml` you should have `LNBITS_ENDPOINT="https://demo.lnbits.com"`.

Note: Don't enter secret environment variables here. Fly.io offers secrets (via the `fly secrets` command) that are exposed as environment variables in your runtime. So, for example, if using the LND_REST funding source, you can run `fly secrets set LND_REST_MACAROON=<hex_macaroon_data>`.

```
...
kill_timeout = 30
...

...
[mounts]
  source="lnbits_data"
  destination="/data"
...

...
[env]
  HOST="127.0.0.1"
  PORT=5000
  FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS="*"
  LNBITS_BASEURL="https://mylnbits.lnbits.org/"
  LNBITS_DATA_FOLDER="/data"

  ${PUT_YOUR_LNBITS_ENV_VARS_HERE}
...

...
[[services]]
  internal_port = 5000
...
```

Next, create a volume to store the sqlite database for LNbits. Be sure to choose the same region for the volume that you chose earlier.

```
fly volumes create lnbits_data --size 1
```

You're ready to deploy! Run `fly deploy` and follow the steps to finish deployment. You'll select a `region` (up to you, choose the same as you did for the storage volume previously created), `postgres` (choose no), `deploy` (choose yes).

You can use `fly logs` to view the application logs, or `fly ssh console` to get a ssh shell in the running container.

### Troubleshooting

Problems installing? These commands have helped us install LNbits.

```sh
sudo apt install pkg-config libffi-dev libpq-dev

# build essentials for debian/ubuntu
sudo apt install python3.10-dev gcc build-essential

# if the secp256k1 build fails:
# if you used poetry
poetry add setuptools wheel
```

### Optional: PostgreSQL database

If you want to use LNbits at scale, we recommend using PostgreSQL as the backend database. Install Postgres and setup a database for LNbits:

```sh
# on debian/ubuntu 'sudo apt-get -y install postgresql'
# or follow instructions at https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/

# Postgres doesn't have a default password, so we'll create one.
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
# on psql
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'myPassword'; # choose whatever password you want
\q
# on postgres user
createdb lnbits
exit
```

You need to edit the `.env` file.

```sh
# add the database connection string to .env 'nano .env' LNBITS_DATABASE_URL=
# postgres://<user>:<myPassword>@<host>:<port>/<lnbits> - alter line bellow with your user, password and db name
LNBITS_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/lnbits"
# save and exit
```

# Using LNbits

Now you can visit your LNbits at http://localhost:5000/.

Now modify the `.env` file with any settings you prefer and add a proper [funding source](./wallets.md) by modifying the value of `LNBITS_BACKEND_WALLET_CLASS` and providing the extra information and credentials related to the chosen funding source.

Then you can restart it and it will be using the new settings.

You might also need to install additional packages or perform additional setup steps, depending on the chosen backend. See [the short guide](./wallets.md) on each different funding source.

Take a look at [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) for an excellent way of spinning up a Lightning Network dev environment.

# Additional guides

## SQLite to PostgreSQL migration

If you already have LNbits installed and running, on an SQLite database, we **highly** recommend you migrate to postgres if you are planning to run LNbits on scale.

There's a script included that can do the migration easy. You should have Postgres already installed and there should be a password for the user (see Postgres install guide above). Additionally, your LNbits instance should run once on postgres to implement the database schema before the migration works:

```sh
# STOP LNbits

# add the database connection string to .env 'nano .env' LNBITS_DATABASE_URL=
# postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>/<database> - alter line bellow with your user, password and db name
LNBITS_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/lnbits"
# save and exit

# START LNbits
# STOP LNbits
poetry run python tools/conv.py
# or
make migration
```

Hopefully, everything works and get migrated... Launch LNbits again and check if everything is working properly.

## LNbits as a systemd service

Systemd is great for taking care of your LNbits instance. It will start it on boot and restart it in case it crashes. If you want to run LNbits as a systemd service on your Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian server, create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/lnbits.service` with the following content:

```
# Systemd unit for lnbits
# /etc/systemd/system/lnbits.service

[Unit]
Description=LNbits
# you can uncomment these lines if you know what you're doing
# it will make sure that lnbits starts after lnd (replace with your own backend service)
#Wants=lnd.service
#After=lnd.service

[Service]
# replace with the absolute path of your lnbits installation
WorkingDirectory=/home/lnbits/lnbits
# same here. run `which poetry` if you can't find the poetry binary
ExecStart=/home/lnbits/.local/bin/poetry run lnbits
# replace with the user that you're running lnbits on
User=lnbits
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file and run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable lnbits.service
sudo systemctl start lnbits.service
```

## Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS using Caddy

Use Caddy to make your LNbits install accessible over clearnet with a domain and https cert.

Point your domain at the IP of the server you're running LNbits on, by making an `A` record.

Install Caddy on the server
https://caddyserver.com/docs/install#debian-ubuntu-raspbian

```
sudo caddy stop
```

Create a Caddyfile

```
sudo nano Caddyfile
```

Assuming your LNbits is running on port `5000` add:

```
yourdomain.com {
  reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:5000 {
    header_up X-Forwarded-Host yourdomain.com
  }
}
```

Save and exit `CTRL + x`

```
sudo caddy start
```

## Running behind an Apache2 reverse proxy over HTTPS

Install Apache2 and enable Apache2 mods:

```sh
apt-get install apache2 certbot
a2enmod headers ssl proxy proxy_http
```

Create a SSL certificate with LetsEncrypt:

```sh
certbot certonly --webroot --agree-tos --non-interactive --webroot-path /var/www/html -d lnbits.org
```

Create an Apache2 vhost at: `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/lnbits.conf`:

```sh
cat <<EOF > /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/lnbits.conf
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName lnbits.org
  SSLEngine On
  SSLProxyEngine On
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/lnbits.org/fullchain.pem
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/lnbits.org/privkey.pem
  Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
  LogLevel info
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/lnbits.log
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/lnbits-access.log combined
  RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
  RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-SSL" expr=%{HTTPS}
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5000/
  <Proxy *>
      Order deny,allow
      Allow from all
  </Proxy>
</VirtualHost>
EOF
```

Restart Apache2:

```sh
service apache2 restart
```

## Running behind an Nginx reverse proxy over HTTPS

Install nginx:

```sh
apt-get install nginx certbot
```

Create a SSL certificate with LetsEncrypt:

```sh
certbot certonly --nginx --agree-tos -d lnbits.org
```

Create an nginx vhost at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lnbits.org`:

```sh
cat <<EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lnbits.org
server {
    server_name lnbits.org;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
    }

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass_request_headers on;

    # WebSocket support
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";

    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/lnbits.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/lnbits.org/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
}
EOF
```

Restart nginx:

```sh
service nginx restart
```

## Using https without reverse proxy

The most common way of using LNbits via https is to use a reverse proxy such as Caddy, nginx, or ngriok. However, you can also run LNbits via https without additional software. This is useful for development purposes or if you want to use LNbits in your local network.

We have to create a self-signed certificate using `mkcert`. Note that this certificate is not "trusted" by most browsers but that's fine (since you know that you have created it) and encryption is always better than clear text.

#### Install mkcert

You can find the install instructions for `mkcert` [here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

Install mkcert on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
curl -JLO "https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64"
chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
```

#### Create certificate

To create a certificate, first `cd` into your LNbits folder and execute the following command on Linux:

```sh
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem
```

This will create two new files (`key.pem` and `cert.pem `).

Alternatively, you can use mkcert ([more info](https://kifarunix.com/how-to-create-self-signed-ssl-certificate-with-mkcert-on-ubuntu-18-04/)):

```sh
# add your local IP (192.x.x.x) as well if you want to use it in your local network
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

You can then pass the certificate files to uvicorn when you start LNbits:

```sh
poetry run uvicorn lnbits.__main__:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --ssl-keyfile ./key.pem --ssl-certfile ./cert.pem
```

## LNbits running on Umbrel behind Tor

If you want to run LNbits on your Umbrel but want it to be reached through clearnet, _Uxellodunum_ made an extensive [guide](https://community.getumbrel.com/t/guide-lnbits-without-tor/604) on how to do it.

## Docker installation

To install using docker you first need to build the docker image as:

```
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits.git
cd lnbits
docker build -t lnbits/lnbits .
```

You can launch the docker in a different directory, but make sure to copy `.env.example` from lnbits there

```
cp <lnbits_repo>/.env.example .env
```

and change the configuration in `.env` as required.

Then create the data directory

```
mkdir data
```

Then the image can be run as:

```
docker run --detach --publish 5000:5000 --name lnbits -e "LNBITS_BACKEND_WALLET_CLASS='FakeWallet'" --volume ${PWD}/.env:/app/.env --volume ${PWD}/data/:/app/data lnbits
```

Finally you can access your lnbits on your machine at port 5000.
